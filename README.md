## Features

Each project in this repository showcases one or more responsive design principles, including:

* **Fluid Grids:** Layouts that resize proportionally based on the viewport.
* **Flexible Images:** Images that scale up or down without overflowing their containers.
* **Media Queries:** CSS rules that apply styles based on device characteristics (e.g., screen width, height, orientation).
* **Viewport Meta Tag:** Essential for controlling the layout on mobile browsers.
* **Mobile-First Approach:** Designing for the smallest screens first and progressively enhancing for larger screens.
* **Flexbox:** A one-dimensional layout module for arranging items in a container.
* **CSS Grid:** A two-dimensional layout system for creating complex grid-based layouts.
* **Responsive Navigation:** Navigation menus that adapt to different screen sizes (e.g., hamburger menus on mobile).
* **Typographic Responsiveness:** Font sizes and line heights that adjust for readability across devices.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and implementing responsive behaviors.
